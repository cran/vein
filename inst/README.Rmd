## Vein Package

**V**ehicular **E**missions **IN**ventory **(VEIN)** model.


### System requirements

vein imports functions from spatial packages listed below. In order to
install these packages, firstly the user must install the requirements
mentioned [here](https://www.github.com/r-spatial/sf).

### Packages needed

After installing system dependencies, you need these packages:

- [sp](https://github.com/edzer/sp/) 
- [units](https://github.com/edzer/units/) 
- [raster](http://cran.r-project.org/package=raster)
- [rgdal](https://github.com/cran/rgdal)
- [rgeos](https://github.com/cran/rgeos)
- [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf)

At the current version of vein, sf is not imported but suggested. Future version
of vein will import or depend on sf, so it is recommended to install it now. Also,
if you want to properly run the demo, install:

- [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2)


### Installation

VEIN can be installed via CRAN or github

```{r eval=F}
# 0.2.3
library(devtools)
install_github("atmoschem/vein")
library(vein)
demo(VEIN)
```

or

```{r eval=F}
# 0.2.3
install.packages("vein")
library(vein)
```


## Classes

VEIN has the following classes:

- Vehicles (1/h) 
- Speed  (km/h)
- EmissionFactors (g/km)
- EmissionFactorsList (g/km)
- Emissions  (g/h)
- EmissionsArray  (g/h)
- EmissionsList  (g/h)
- Evaporative  (g/d)

Each class has the methods print, plot and summary.

### How to use vein

VEIN consist of: "Elaboration of vehicular emissions inventories,
    consisting in four stages, pre-processing activity data, preparing 
    emissions factors, estimating the emissions and post-processing of emissions 
    in maps and databases."

This implies the use of several functions in a coordinates ans structured way,
therefore it is added the new function **vein** which creates a structured
set of directories and scripts to run VEIN. Please, read the examples in the
documentation of each function and run the demo.

```{r eval = FALSE}
vein::inventory(name = "YourCity")
```


###  Issues

If you encounter any issues while using VEIN, please submit your issues to: https://github.com/atmoschem/vein/issues/

If you have any suggestions just let me know to sergio.ibarra@usp.br.

Thanks and enjoy VEIN!

### **future steps**

- Migrate to [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/)
- Estimation of evaporative emissions with Copert Tier 3
- More speciations
- Solve issues
- Vignettes, blogs and a book (hopefully released in 2018)

#### Note:
The current versioning in VEIN is X.X.X-X. This is because version 0.2.2 is
in a paper on GMDD under open review: 

Ibarra-Espinosa, S., Ynoue, R., O'Sullivan, S., Pebesma, E.,
  Andrade, M. D. F., and Osses, M. (2017). VEIN v0.2.2: an R
  package for bottom-up Vehicular Emissions Inventories Geosci.
  Model Dev. Discus, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2017-193, in
  review, 2017.

However, once the paper is ready, the new versioning of VEIN will be:

- CRAN: X.X.X
- GITHUB: X.X.X-X (which will be more frequent from now)
- .9000 developemnt or experimental.

For example: Github: 0.2.2-30, next relase would be CRAN: 0.2.3.
