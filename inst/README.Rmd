## Vein Package

**V**ehicular **E**missions **IN**ventory **(VEIN)** model.

_Please read the documentation_.

### System requirements

vein imports functions from spatial packages listed below. In order to
install these packages, firstly the user must install the requirements
mentioned [here](https://www.github.com/r-spatial/sf).

### Packages needed

After installing system dependencies, you need these packages:

- [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf)
- [sp](https://github.com/edzer/sp/) 
- [lwgeom](https://github.com/r-spatial/lwgeom/) 
- [units](https://github.com/edzer/units/) 

In order to run the demo, this package is also needed:

```

or

```{r eval=F}
install.packages("vein")
library(vein)
demo(VEIN)
```

## What is new?

I decided to jump into a new 'minor' version because it brings lots of cool
improvements.

- vein imports **sf** functions.
- R packages -raster-, -rgdal- and -rgeos- not needed anymore.
- vein now imports **data-table**.
- Add class GriddedEmissionsArray.
- Fix #28, data.table imported in emis_grid. Now it is very fast!
- Fix #49: Documentation in inventory est.
- Fix #50: Fix repetition of x_DF.
- Fix #51: deparse text.
- Fix #52: separate objects in rm with ','
- Fix #55.
- Minor fix on demo(VEIN).
- emis and emis_cold adjust length of ef by length of columns of first
element of the list of data-frames.
- Revised all examples.
- returns sf in temp_fact, netspeed and emis_post! (0.3.17)

Check the [NEWS](https://github.com/atmoschem/vein/blob/master/NEWS.md)

**future steps**

- Add more support to sf.
- Estimation of evaporative emissions with Copert Tier 3.
- More speciations.
- A book (hopefully released in 2018).



## How does it work?

VEIN consist of: "Elaboration of vehicular emissions inventories,
    consisting in four stages,
1) pre-processing activity data,
2) preparing emissions factors,
3) estimating the emissions and
4) post-processing of emissions in maps and databases."


This implies the use of several functions in a coordinates ans structured way,
therefore it is added the new function **inventory** which creates a structured
set of directories and scripts to run VEIN. Please, open the file 'main.R' and
run each line to understand VEIN. **Remember, if you have doubts with any function,
just type '?' with the name of the function. For intance: `?inventory`.**

```{r eval = T, include = T, echo = T}
library(vein)
inventory(name = file.path(tempdir(), "YourCity"), show.dir = T,
          show.scripts = T)
```

Please, read the examples in the documentation of each function and run the demo. 

### 1) Examples with traffic data:

age functions 

```{r eval = T, include = T, echo = T}
data("net")
PC_E25_1400 <- age_ldv(x = net$ldv, name = "PC_E25_1400")
plot(PC_E25_1400, xlab = "age of use")
```

If you want to know the vehicles per street and by age of use, just
add the net. Age functions now returns 'sf' objects if the net argument is present.

```{r eval = T, include = T, echo = T}
PC_E25_1400net <- age_ldv(x = net$ldv, name = "PC_E25_1400", net = net)
sp::spplot(as(PC_E25_1400net, "Spatial"),
       c("PC_E25_1400_1", "PC_E25_1400_9"),
       main = "PC by age of use", scales = list(draw = T),
       col.regions = rev(cptcity::cpt()))
```

temporal factors and netspeed
```{r eval = T, include = T, echo = T}
data("net")
data("pc_profile")
pc_week <- temp_fact(net$ldv+net$hdv, pc_profile)
dfspeed <- netspeed(pc_week, net$ps, net$ffs, net$capacity, net$lkm, alpha = 1.5)
class(dfspeed)
plot(dfspeed, xlab = "Hours", ylab = "Speed [km/h]") 
```

If you want ot check the speed at different hours by street, just add net:

```{r eval = T, include = T, echo = T}
dfspeednet <- netspeed(pc_week, net$ps, net$ffs, net$capacity, net$lkm,
                       alpha = 1.5, net = net)
sp::spplot(as(dfspeednet, "Spatial"),
       c("S1", "S9"), scales = list(draw = T),
       col.regions = rev(cptcity::cpt()))
```

### 2) Emission Factors

```{r eval = T, include = T, echo = T}
V <- 0:150
ef1 <- ef_ldv_speed(v = "PC",t = "4S", cc = "<=1400", f = "G", eu = "PRE",
p = "CO")
efs <- EmissionFactors(ef1(1:150))
plot(Speed(1:150), efs, xlab = "speed[km/h]", type = "b", pch = 16)
```

### 3) Estimation of emissions

```{r eval = T, include = T, echo = T}
euro <- c(rep("V", 5), rep("IV", 5), rep("III", 5), rep("II", 5),
          rep("I", 5), rep("PRE", 15))
lef <- lapply(1:40, function(i) {
ef_ldv_speed(v = "PC", t = "4S", cc = "<=1400", f = "G",
          eu = euro[i], p = "CO", show.equation = FALSE) })
E_CO <- emis(veh = PC_E25_1400, lkm = net$lkm, ef = lef, speed = dfspeed,
             profile = pc_profile)
plot(E_CO, xlab = "Hours", ylab = "[g/h]")
```

### 4) Post Emissions

```{r eval = T, include = T, echo = T}
E_CO_STREETS <- emis_post(arra = E_CO, pollutant = "CO", by = "streets_wide")
```

make a grid. If you plan to run WRF, use:

when spobj is "character", it is a path to wrfinput file and
then runs eixport::wrf_grid to create a grid based on a wrf_input file.

1) Create a grid using `make_grid`.The spobj is the spatial net
2) spobj is "character", it is a path to wrfinput file and the grid will have
the size of the wrf_input.

```{r eval = T, include = T, echo = T}
data(net)
E_CO_STREETSnet <- emis_post(arra = E_CO, pollutant = "CO", by = "streets_wide",
                             net = net)
g <- make_grid(net, 1/102.47/2) #500m in degrees
E_CO_g <- emis_grid(spobj = E_CO_STREETSnet, g = g, sr= 31983)
sp::spplot(as(E_CO_g, "Spatial"),
       c("V1", "V9"), scales = list(draw = T),
       col.regions = rev(cptcity::cpt()))
```

### Creating a WRFChem Input file using [eixport](https://atmoschem.github.io/eixport/):

1) If you created a grid using a wrfinput file and then ran emis_gris to
grid your emissions, create a GriddedEmissionsArray and then  use


a) [eixport::wrf_create](https://atmoschem.github.io/eixport/reference/wrf_create.html)
to create a wrfchem input file with 0.
b) [eixport::wrf_put](https://atmoschem.github.io/eixport/reference/wrf_put.html)
to the wrfchem input file.

```{r eval = FALSE}
eixport::wrf_create(wrfinput_dir = "PathToWrfInput", wrfchemi_dir = "OutputPathWrfChemInput")
gwrf <- eixport::wrf_grd("PathToWrfInput")
E_CO_gwrf <- emis_grid(spobj = E_CO_STREETSnet, g = gwrf)
gr <- GriddedEmissionsArray(E_CO_gwrf, rows = 19, cols = 23, times = 168, T)
eixport::wrf_put(file = "PathToWRFChemInputFile, name = "E_CO", POL = gr)
```


2) If you created a grid using a spatial net, use
[vein::wmis_wrf](https://atmoschem.github.io/vein/reference/emis_wrf.html)
 or [eixport::as4wrf](https://atmoschem.github.io/eixport/reference/to_as4wrf.html)
and get the NCL script AS4WRF.ncl from the developer.



Thanks and enjoy VEIN!
