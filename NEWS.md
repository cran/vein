- netspeed argument isList changed to scheme
- Versions with three numbers. Fix speciate for "iag"
- Corrected sysdata for PC with gasoline euro PRE pollutant HC
- In emis, emis_cold and emis_paved: agemax  =  ncol(veh) by default

### vein v0.1.1.1 (Release date: 2017-03-25)

- Added some categories to bcom
- To avoid confusion with the REMI model (www.remi.com),
the name was changed to Vehicular Emissions INventory Model (vein).

____________________________________________________________________________________

###  REMI v0.1.0-31 (Release date: 2017-03-13)

- New function: my_age. Distribute vehicle data using own vehicle distribution
from a numeric vector.
- Description title changed from "An R package for elaborating emissions
inventories" to "An R package for traffic emissions modelling".
- age functions now used colSums for messaging average age.
- sysdata for table of EMEP/EEA PC emission factors, TYPE now has value "ALL"
when EURO is "PRE".
- ef_ldv_speed size motor FC Euro IV, V, VI and VIc changed from "800_1400"
to "<=1400" to create have a faster and easier estimation with ef_ldv_scaled.
The category <=800 remains.
- ef_ldv_speed_cold called a database with some errors in ifelse closure.
Now fixed.
- Age function nows append element equal to the last element of the
vector.

- Includes function ef_ldv_cold_list for list of cold start emission factors.
  Also, the function emissions_cold.
- The internal dataframe with EMEP emission factor for ldv vehicles
  changes type from "PRE_ECE" to "PRE".
- bus fix in emissions_dow and emissions_cold when array=F.
- emissions 24 were changed to lapply over the length of ef.
