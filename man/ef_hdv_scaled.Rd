\value{
A list of scaled emission factors g/km
}
\description{
\code{\link{ef_hdv_scaled}} creates a list of scaled functions of emission factors. A scaled
emission factor which at a speed of the dricing cycle (SDC) gives a desired value.
This function needs a dataframe with local emission factors with a columns with
the name "Euro_HDV" indicating the Euro equivalence standard, assuming that there are
available local emission factors for several consecutive years.
}
\note{
The length of the list should be equal to the name of the age categories of
a specific type of vehicle
