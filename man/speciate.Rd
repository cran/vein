\title{Speciation of emissions}
\usage{
speciate(x, spec = "bcom", veh, fuel, eu, show = FALSE, list = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Emissions estimation}

\item{spec}{speciation: The speciations are: "bcom", tyre", "break", "road",
"iag", "nox" and "nmhc". 'iag' now includes a speciation for use of industrial and
building paintings. "bcom" stands for black carbon and organic matter.}

\item{veh}{Type of vehicle:
When spec is "bcom" or "nox" veh can be "PC", "LCV", HDV" or "Motorcycle".
When spec is "iag" veh can take two values depending:
when the speciation is for vehicles veh accepts "veh", eu "Evaporative",
"Liquid" or "Exhaust" and fuel "G", "E" or "D",
when the speciation is for painting, veh is "paint" fuel or eu can be
"industrial" or "building"
when spec is "nmhc", veh can be "LDV" with fuel "G" or "D" and eu "PRE", "I",
"II", "III", "IV", "V", or "VI".
when spec is "nmhc", veh can be "HDV" with fuel "D" and eu  "PRE", "I",
"II", "III", "IV", "V", or "VI".
when spec is "nmhc" and fuel is "LPG", veh and eu must be "ALL"}

\item{fuel}{Fuel. When spec is "bcom" fuel can be "G" or "D".
When spec is "iag" fuel can be "G", "E" or "D". When spec is "nox" fuel can
be "G", "D", "LPG", "E85" or "CNG". Not required for "tyre", "break" or "road".
When spec is "nmhc" fuel can be G, D or LPG.}

\item{eu}{Euro emission standard: "PRE", "ECE_1501", "ECE_1502", "ECE_1503",
"I", "II", "III", "IV",  "V", "III-CDFP","IV-CDFP","V-CDFP", "III-ADFP",
"IV-ADFP","V-ADFP" and "OPEN_LOOP". When spec is "iag" accept the values
"Exhaust" "Evaporative" and "Liquid". When spec is "nox" eu can be
"PRE", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "VIc", "III-DPF" or "III+CRT".
Not required for "tyre", "break" or "road"}

\item{show}{when TRUE shows row of table with respective speciation}

\item{list}{when TRUE returns a list with number of elements of the list as
the number species of pollutants}
}
\value{
dataframe of speciation in grams or mols
}
\description{
\code{speciate} separates emissions in different compounds.
It covers black carbon and organic matter from particulate matter. Soon it
will be added more speciations
}
\note{
when spec = "iag", veh is only "VEH", STANDARD is "Evaporative",
"Liquid" or "Exhaust", FUEL is "G" for gasoline (blended with 25\% ethanol),
 "E" for Ethanol and "D" for diesel (blended with 5\% of biodiesel).
 When spec = "bcom", veh can be "PC", "LCV", "Motorcycle" or "HDV"
  VEH", STANDARD is "Evaporative",
"Liquid" or "Exhaust", FUEL is "G" for gasoline (blended with 25\% ethanol),
 "E" for Ethanol and "D" for diesel (blended with 5\% of biodiesel).
