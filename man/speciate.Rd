\title{Speciation of emissions}
\usage{
speciate(x, spec = "bcom", veh, fuel, eu, show = FALSE, list = FALSE,
  dx)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Emissions estimation}

\item{spec}{speciation: The speciations are: "bcom", tyre" (or "tire"), "brake", "road",
"iag", "nox" and "nmhc". 'iag' now includes a speciation for use of industrial and
building paintings. "bcom" stands for black carbon and organic matter. "pmiag"
speciates PM2.5 and requires only argument x of PM2.5 emissions in g/h/km^2 as
gridded emissions (flux). It also accepts one of the following pollutants:
'e_eth', 'e_hc3', 'e_hc5', 'e_hc8', 'e_ol2', 'e_olt', 'e_oli',
'e_iso', 'e_tol', 'e_xyl', 'e_c2h5oh', 'e_hcho', 'e_ch3oh', 'e_ket',
"e_so4i", "e_so4j", "e_no3i", "e_no3j", "e_pm2.5i",
"e_pm2.5j", "e_orgi", "e_orgj", "e_eci", "e_ecj". Also "h2o"}

\item{veh}{Type of vehicle:
When spec is "bcom" or "nox" veh can be "PC", "LCV", HDV" or "Motorcycle".
When spec is "iag" veh can take two values depending:
when the speciation is for vehicles veh accepts "veh", eu "Evaporative",
"Liquid" or "Exhaust" and fuel "G", "E" or "D",
when the speciation is for painting, veh is "paint" fuel or eu can be
"industrial" or "building"
when spec is "nmhc", veh can be "LDV" with fuel "G" or "D" and eu "PRE", "I",
"II", "III", "IV", "V", or "VI".
when spec is "nmhc", veh can be "HDV" with fuel "D" and eu  "PRE", "I",
"II", "III", "IV", "V", or "VI".
when spec is "nmhc" and fuel is "LPG", veh and eu must be "ALL"}

\item{fuel}{Fuel. When spec is "bcom" fuel can be "G" or "D".
When spec is "iag" fuel can be "G", "E" or "D". When spec is "nox" fuel can
be "G", "D", "LPG", "E85" or "CNG". Not required for "tyre", "brake" or "road".
When spec is "nmhc" fuel can be G, D or LPG.}

\item{eu}{Euro emission standard: "PRE", "ECE_1501", "ECE_1502", "ECE_1503",
"I", "II", "III", "IV",  "V", "III-CDFP","IV-CDFP","V-CDFP", "III-ADFP",
"IV-ADFP","V-ADFP" and "OPEN_LOOP". When spec is "iag" accept the values
"Exhaust" "Evaporative" and "Liquid". When spec is "nox" eu can be
"PRE", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "VIc", "III-DPF" or "III+CRT".
Not required for "tyre", "brake" or "road"}

\item{show}{when TRUE shows row of table with respective speciation}

\item{list}{when TRUE returns a list with number of elements of the list as
the number species of pollutants}

\item{dx}{Integer, used when spec = "pmiag". It is the spatial disntace}
}
\value{
dataframe of speciation in grams or mols
}
\description{
\code{speciate} separates emissions in different compounds.
It covers black carbon and organic matter from particulate matter. Soon it
will be added more speciations
}
\note{
when spec = "iag":
veh is only "veh",
fuel is "G"  (blended with 25\% ethanol), "D" (blended with 5\% of biodiesel)
or "E" (Ethanol 100\%).
eu is "Evaporative", "Liquid" or "Exhaust",

emissions of "pmiag" speciate pm2.5 into e_so4i, e_so4j, e_no3i,
e_no3j, e_mp2.5i, e_mp2.5j, e_orgi, e_orgj, e_eci, e_ecj and h2o. Reference:
