\usage{
emis_paved(veh, lkm, k = 0.62, sL1 = 0.6, sL2 = 0.2, sL3 = 0.06,
  sL4 = 0.03, W)
}
\arguments{
\item{veh}{Numeric vector with length of elements equals to number of streets
It is an array with dimenssions number of streets x hours of day x days of week}

\item{lkm}{Length of each link}

\item{k}{K_PM30 = 3.23 (g/vkm), K_PM15 = 0.77 (g/vkm), K_PM10 = 0.62 (g/vkm)
and K_PM2.5 = 0.15  (g/vkm).}

\item{sL1}{Silt loading (g/m2) for roads with ADT <= 500}

\item{sL2}{Silt loading (g/m2) for roads with ADT > 500 and <= 5000}

\item{sL3}{Silt loading (g/m2) for roads with ADT > 5000 and <= 1000}

\item{sL4}{Silt loading (g/m2) for roads with ADT > 10000}

\item{W}{array of dimensions of veh. It consists in the hourly averaged
weight of traffic fleet in each road}
}
\value{
emission estimation  g/h

\description{
\code{emis_paved} estimates vehicular emissions from paved roads.
The vehicular emissions are estimated as the product of the vehicles on a
road, length of the road, emission factor from AP42 13.2.1 Paved roads.
It is assumed dry hours and anual aggregation should consider moisture factor.
It depends on Average Daily Traffic (ADT)
